# pico_ssd1306

 This repo is a template to create a Pico project that uses an LCD of type ssd1306.
 This assumes that you have configured all the toolchains for Clion for you to use with Pico and downloaded the pico-SDK as detailed in this document.
 https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf
 
 This has been tested on my machine in a Linux environment, so there are no guarantees that it should work for you.
 For me, the configuration clones and sets up a project with some example code that successfully builds when I build the project.
 
 Use the demo_ssd1306.c file to add your code; you should be able to refactor demo_ssd1306 to a more suitable name.

This repository can be cloned directly with Clion.
use the get from VCS option.
Use the repo at https://github.com/optimho/pico_ssd1306_lcd.git   as the GitHub URL.
